Here are the specific claims in the video that include numerical or concrete supporting data.[1]

### Quantified claims
- Shares of the four largest U.S. private credit firms have jumped roughly 1,000% over the last eight years, more than double the NASDAQ 100 over the same period.[1]
- The private credit market expanded from about $230 billion in 2008 to roughly $1.6 trillion, now nearing about 6% of U.S. GDP.[1]
- Traditional bank financing has become a key source of leverage for private credit managers, implying potential stress transmission to regulated banks if the sector falters (attributed in the video to an IMF report).[1]
- Market concentration: Apollo, Blackstone, Ares, Brookfield, and KKR together account for over 50% of the private credit market.[1]
- Reported private credit manager performance has been in the range of 15–20% annual gains over the last decade, drawing increased investor inflows.[1]
- Covenant quality: 91% of outstanding leveraged loans in the private credit market are categorized as covenant-lite.[1]
- Historical analogy: private‑label mortgage-backed securities were about 5% of GDP in 2003 and rose to roughly 18% within about four years before the financial crisis.[1]
- Outlook cited: BlackRock estimates private credit could reach about $4.5 trillion by 2030, equating to roughly 15% of GDP within about four years, paralleling the early‑2000s MBS growth pace noted in the video.[1]
