The Coin Bureau Trading video titled *“Emergency Crypto Market Update: History is Repeating!!”* (October 17, 2025) argues that the recent crypto crash is being driven by an emerging **private credit crisis** that could mirror the **subprime mortgage collapse of 2007–08**. Dan from Coin Bureau suggests that this opaque and under-regulated lending sector—where funds chase high yields—has begun to destabilize smaller U.S. banks, crypto treasuries, and other leveraged entities.[1]

### Key Points from the Video
- **Crisis Origin:** Private credit funds, which provide loans outside traditional banking channels, are showing signs of stress. Some small U.S. banks’ stocks are falling amid fears of exposure to these loans.  
- **Crypto Link:** Dan claims that many *crypto treasuries* (e.g., MicroStrategy and similar entities) depended on private-credit-backed funding. Stress in that sector since **July 2025** may have suppressed crypto’s performance even as equities and gold stayed strong.[1]
- **Trigger Events:** Reports like Coindesk’s (now removed) suggested that crypto-related credit markets started wobbling mid-summer. In September, failures at subprime auto lenders highlighted contagion risks within private credit—echoing the 2007 pattern.[1]
- **Federal Reserve Outlook:** Because private credit markets are opaque, Dan expects the **Fed will need to intervene** through emergency rate cuts or new liquidity programs. He warns that **Bitcoin and other risk assets could continue falling** until this happens, followed by a “V-shaped” rebound similar to mid-2007’s brief rally ahead of the eventual crisis.[1]
- **Market Analogy:** The situation parallels early 2007—initial credit losses, rapid policy response, then a sharp top before a systemic downturn. Dan anticipates a possible market top in **December 2025** if history repeats itself.[1]

### Wider Market Context (October 2025)
Independent analyses support a backdrop of extreme pressure:
- On **October 10**, over **$19 billion in leveraged crypto positions** were liquidated—the largest single-day wipeout ever recorded.[2][3]
- Bitcoin briefly plunged below **$105,000** before rebounding; Ethereum dropped over **12%**.[2]
- The crash coincided with **President Trump’s sudden 100% tariff on Chinese imports**, sparking panic across global markets.[2]
- The **IMF** has also warned of growing odds of a “disorderly” global market correction due to trade tensions and overvalued risk assets.[4]

### Summary
Dan’s thesis ties the crypto bear trend since July to stress in the **private credit system**, contending that liquidity drying up there cascades into crypto weakness. Unless the Fed acts soon, he expects deeper drawdowns—but also a massive rebound once intervention arrives, resembling pre-crisis behavior seen in 2007.
