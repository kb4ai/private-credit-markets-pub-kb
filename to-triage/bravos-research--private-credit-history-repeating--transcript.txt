The shares of the four largest private credit firms in the United States have all jumped by roughly 1,000% over the course of the last eight years. That's more than double the Nasdaq 100's performance over the same period of time. But the problem is not that these firms are doing well. It's why they're doing so well that is becoming increasingly concerning. Since 2008, the size of the private credit market has grown from just $230 billion, now being $1.6 trillion trillion dollars and almost 6% of GDP. The original idea behind private credit was quite straightforward and well founded. After the near collapse of the banking system in 2008, regulators and policymakers wanted to move risky loans away from traditional banks and into private hands. The idea was to keep the more risky and questionable parts of banking completely separate from the place where regular people deposit their money. But that's not exactly how it worked out. In fact, quite the opposite. A report from the International Monet Fund recently highlighted that traditional bank financing has become a key source of leverage for these private credit firms. That means if this sector were to come under stress, the shock would not stay private. It would likely spill over into the regulated banking system. This could create a feedback loop where stress in private credit puts pressure on bank liquidity, forcing them to tighten their lending, which would further squeeze private credit firms applying even greater pressure on the banking system. This threat is especially real given that almost the entire private credit market is concentrated in just five firms. Apollo, Blackstone, Ares, Brookfield and KKR together now account for over 50% of the entire private credit market. That means the stability of this trillion dollar industry is tied to just a handful of firms, which could already be putting them into the too big to fail category. For years, the assumption was that these firms would handle the responsibility of risky lending better than traditional banks, since simply because they could go bust if they ever became too speculative. But now that these companies have reached a larger size, it seems they're becoming increasingly confident in adopting risky lending behavior. Private credit managers have been consistently posting annual gains in the range of 15 to 20% over the last decade, which has attracted flocks of new investors to the industry, a retailization of the industry that the IMF has warned about. But if you know anything about how a date debt market works, a high return on investment like a 15 to 20% yield equals to a higher risk that is being taken by the lender. In private credit. Those risks often come from opaque deal structures that rely on leverage through credit lines extended by banks and These firms are being pushed to increase their risk in order to continue delivering strong returns to avoid losing their share of the market. A clear example of this can be seen through something called a loan covenant. Covenants are the rules built into loan agreements that are meant to protect lenders. Factors like financial tests that accompany borrowing money has to meet in order to prove that it can continue to pay its debt. What we've seen in recent years is an increasing percentage of leveraged loans in the Covenant Light category. These are loans where the rules meant to protect the lender are looser. Currently, 91% of outstanding leveraged loans in the private credit market are categorized as Covenant Light. This is very important to understand because it means that default, default rates on these loans could be artificially low right now, despite underlying structural issues that a lot of the companies borrowing money from. These private credit firms could actually be hiding problems that we can't see because of the lack of transparency and because of the lack of rules protecting the lender. Now, it's entirely possible that everything is actually fine. But it could also be that a large percentage of these firms that have taken on leverage loans would default if economic conditions were to shift, putting the entire private credit industry at risk. The truth is, we just don't know. What we do know is that leveraged loans are spreading like wildfire across the financial industry. They're looking increasingly risky and they are tightly linked to the traditional banking system. It's no surprise that multiple financial institutions have been warning about these trends, as a lot of this certainly has some 2008 like vibes. But for now, private credit is only a teenager. The market has grown to represent roughly 5% of US GDP over the course of the last 10 years. For reference, this is what the growth trajectory of private label mortgage backed securities looks like in the early 2000s, before they triggered the financial crisis. These were the extremely opaque, highly risky instruments that were a root cause behind the financial crisis. And in 2003, they represented about 5% of GDP, just like private credit today. As you can see, however, in roughly four years time, private label mortgage backed securities grew from 5% to 18% of GDP. BlackRock currently estimates that by 2030, private credit could expand to $4.5 trillion, or about 15% of GDP. That's time, which would be a very close match to the growth rate that private label mortgage backed securities followed in the early 2000s. As the saying goes, history may not repeat, but it often rhymes. The goal of this video is not to scare you out of the market. In fact, quite the opposite. Although we are seeing risks build up at a rapid pace which could blow up down the line, we actually think the music is still playing for the private credit market and this could even be a sector that we trade in the coming months as macro conditions remain favorable for it to be. We've been on a tear with our trades at Braavos Research. In the past few months, we've been booking double digit winning trades one after the other.
