## CORE INTELLIGENCE GAPS REQUIRING DEEP RESEARCH

### 1. Crypto Treasury Companies: Convertible Debt Dynamics & Systemic Leverage

**MICROSTRATEGY (MSTR) — THE BENCHMARK CASE:**

**Current Holdings & Debt Structure (VERIFY/UPDATE):**

* **628,791 BTC** accumulated as of latest disclosure
* **$7.27B convertible debt** (5-year total) at zero-interest rates
* Mechanics: Sell convertible notes → buy Bitcoin → stock price rises → note holders profit from conversion option → company gets free money
* **CRITICAL VULNERABILITY:** $5B in notes traded BELOW conversion price (Feb 2025) → if BTC drops enough, notes must be repaid in CASH → forced BTC liquidation

**RESEARCH DEMANDS:**

1. **GET EXACT CONVERTIBLE NOTE STRUCTURE:**
   * Maturity dates for ALL tranches: 2027, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032
   * Conversion prices for each tranche: $X per share
   * Current MSTR stock price vs each conversion price: Premium/discount %
   * Total cash repayment obligation if BTC crashes: $Y billion
   * Bitcoin price required to avoid cash repayment: $Z per BTC

2. **CALCULATE LIQUIDATION CASCADE THRESHOLDS:**
   * If MSTR needs $5B cash and must sell Bitcoin, how many BTC at current prices?
   * What % of daily Bitcoin volume does this represent?
   * Market impact: Selling X BTC over Y days = -Z% Bitcoin price (use market depth data)
   * Feedback loop: MSTR sells → BTC drops → more notes fall below conversion → more selling needed

3. **STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY ANALYSIS:**
   * $543 (Nov 2024) → $235 (Feb 2025, -55%) → $450 (Jul 2025, +91%)
   * Correlation with Bitcoin: ρ = ? (calculate 30/60/90-day rolling)
   * **IS MSTR MORE VOLATILE THAN BITCOIN?** β coefficient?
   * Implied volatility in MSTR options vs GBTC/IBIT Bitcoin ETF options

4. **PRIVATE CREDIT CONNECTION:**
   * Has MSTR borrowed from private credit firms? Check all SEC filings 2023-2025
   * Do convertible note holders include private credit funds? (Ares, Apollo, Blackstone)
   * Are notes being packaged into CLOs or structured products?
   * **TRACE THE MONEY:** Who bought the $3B Nov 2024 + $2B Feb 2025 offerings?

**METAPLANET (JAPAN) — THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE:**

**CRITICAL SYSTEMIC WARNING:**

* First major treasury company trading **BELOW Bitcoin NAV** (mNAV 0.99x, Oct 2025)
* Peak premium: **5.12x NAV** (June 2025) → current 0.99x = **-81% premium collapse**
* Stock price: $13 → $3.20 = **-75% crash**

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

* When treasury companies trade below NAV, the business model is BROKEN
* Investors can buy Bitcoin directly cheaper than buying the company
* Company cannot raise more capital (who would buy stock at discount to Bitcoin they can buy directly?)
* If Metaplanet is first, **WHO'S NEXT?** MSTR? MARA? BTCS?

**RESEARCH PRIORITIES:**

1. **FULL LIST OF BITCOIN TREASURY COMPANIES:**
   * 161 companies reportedly hold >1M BTC total
   * Get names, tickers, BTC holdings, debt amounts, NAV premiums/discounts
   * **RANK BY VULNERABILITY:** Debt/BTC ratio, premium collapse, stock performance

2. **METAPLANET FORENSICS:**
   * What caused the premium collapse? Regulatory issues? Debt problems? Management?
   * How much debt does Metaplanet have? Maturity dates?
   * At current stock price, can they raise more capital?
   * **CONTAGION RISK:** Are other treasury companies' premiums compressing? Track daily

**MARATHON DIGITAL (MARA) — HYBRID MODEL:**

* Mining operations + **52,850 BTC treasury** (Oct 2025)
* **$950M convertible debt** financing
* Q2 2025 net income: **$808.2M** (operational cash flow positive)

**RESEARCH:**

* Debt servicing: Can mining revenue cover interest? Or dependent on Bitcoin price appreciation?
* If Bitcoin drops 50%, what happens to mining margins AND treasury NAV?
* Dual exposure: Operating leverage (mining difficulty, energy costs) + balance sheet leverage (BTC holdings, debt)

**BTCS — ETHEREUM PIVOT:**

* Announced $57.8M-$100M convertible + **AAVE DeFi borrowing** for **14,600 ETH**
* Stock: +110% on announcement (July 2025)

**UNIQUE RISKS:**

* Ethereum vs Bitcoin correlation: ρ = 0.85-0.90 (historically) but diverges during stress
* **DEFI BORROWING ON AAVE:** Smart contract risk, liquidation thresholds, on-chain transparency
* Access AAVE position address: Check collateralization ratio, borrowed amount, liquidation price
* If ETH drops to $X, does AAVE liquidate BTCS position? At what price?

**COMPREHENSIVE TREASURY COMPANY RISK MATRIX:**

| Company | Ticker | BTC/ETH Holdings | Debt Amount | Debt/Holdings Ratio | NAV Premium | Stock YTD | Liquidation Risk |

### 2. On-Chain Private Credit: Tokenized Lending & DeFi Interconnections

**MARKET SIZING:**

* Total tokenized RWA: **$33.84B ATH** (Oct 13, 2025) → $30-31B currently
* Private credit segment: **$17.6B (58% of RWA market)**
* Growth: $5B (2022) → $24B (mid-2025) = **+380%** in 2.5 years

**VERIFY & UPDATE:**

* RWA.xyz dashboard: Get EXACT figures as of latest date
* Breakdown by protocol: Figure, Tradable, Maple, Goldfinch, others
* Which is growing fastest? Which has highest institutional AUM?

**FIGURE TECHNOLOGIES (FIGR) — MARKET DOMINATOR:**

* **$10-11B AUM (75% market share)** on Provenance blockchain
* Nasdaq IPO Sept 2025: Ticker FIGR, **$7.6B valuation**
* Lifetime origination: **$16B**

**RESEARCH IMPERATIVES:**

1. **STOCK PERFORMANCE SINCE IPO:**
   * IPO price: $X, current price: $Y (get exact)
   * Trading volume, institutional ownership
   * Q3 2025 earnings: Default rates, origination volume, profit margins

2. **ASSET QUALITY:**
   * What types of loans? (Home equity, auto, personal, commercial)
   * Average LTV, FICO scores, delinquency rates
   * Geographic concentration (California, Florida, Texas?)
   * **EXPOSURE TO PRIVATE CREDIT FIRMS:** Are they originating then selling to Apollo/Ares/KKR?

3. **BLOCKCHAIN BENEFITS QUANTIFICATION:**
   * Cost savings vs traditional origination: $X per loan
   * Settlement speed: T+X days vs T+Y traditional
   * Transparency: Can we audit loan-level performance on-chain?
   * **FIND THE PROVENANCE EXPLORER:** Audit actual loan performance real-time

**TRADABLE (ZKYNC L2) — HIGH-YIELD INSTITUTIONAL:**

* **$1.8B** across 30+ positions
* Yields: **8-15.5%**
* Partnership: **Victory Park Capital >$2B**
* Assets: Fintech senior secured, legal receivables, music royalties

**DEEP DIVE REQUIRED:**

1. **VICTORY PARK CAPITAL DUE DILIGENCE:**
   * AUM: $8.2B (verify)
   * Investment strategy: What types of companies do they lend to?
   * Historical default rates: What's their track record?
   * **IS VICTORY PARK ITSELF A PRIVATE CREDIT FIRM?** Where do THEY borrow from?

2. **TRADABLE LOAN-LEVEL TRANSPARENCY:**
   * Can we access specific loan details on ZKsync explorer?
   * Which companies/collateral back the $1.8B?
   * Real-time delinquency monitoring
   * **STRESS TEST:** If private credit defaults hit 10%, what's Tradable impact?

3. **LEGAL RECEIVABLES RISK:**
   * What % of AUM? (Could be most risky)
   * Underlying cases: Settlement amounts, timing uncertainty
   * Historical performance: Do legal receivables default more than corporate loans?

**MAPLE FINANCE — POST-DEFAULT RESTRUCTURING:**

* **$620M TVL**, $777M active loans (June 2025)
* Lifetime: **>$3.3B**
* **MAJOR DEFAULTS 2022:** Orthogonal Trading + M11 Credit = $31M + 3,900 wETH
* Bitwise ($12B AUM) allocated March 2025 = institutional confidence restoration

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**

1. **DEFAULT FORENSICS:**
   * What went wrong with Orthogonal/M11? Fraud? Overleveraging? Correlated bets?
   * How much did lenders lose? (Recovery rate %)
   * What structural changes did Maple make post-crisis?

2. **NEW MODEL SUSTAINABILITY:**
   * Shifted to **over-collateralized** vs under-collateralized
   * What collateral ratios? (e.g., 150% collateral for 100% loan)
   * What assets accepted? (ETH, WBTC, stablecoins, tokenized RWAs?)
   * Liquidation mechanisms: Automated or manual? Slippage estimates?

3. **BITWISE ALLOCATION SIGNIFICANCE:**
   * Bitwise manages $12B crypto AUM — major institutional player
   * How much did they allocate to Maple? $10M? $100M? $1B?
   * Due diligence requirements: What convinced them post-defaults?
   * **ARE OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOLLOWING?** Track institutional allocations to DeFi credit

**GOLDFINCH PRIME — ULTRA-INSTITUTIONAL:**

* **$724K TVL** (tiny but high-pedigree)
* Partners: **Apollo, Ares, Golub** (collectively **>$1T AUM**)
* Requirements: ≥$1B AUM, ≥10yr experience, ≥90% senior secured, ~1% non-accrual
* Target yields: **9-12% net**

**STRATEGIC QUESTIONS:**

1. **WHY ARE APOLLO/ARES USING GOLDFINCH?**
   * Regulatory arbitrage? (Crypto yields without bank charter?)
   * Liquidity management? (Tokenized loans = more tradable?)
   * Client demand? (Crypto investors want exposure to TradFi credit?)

2. **WHAT LOANS ARE THEY TOKENIZING?**
   * Are these the SAME loans in their private credit funds?
   * Or separate vintage/quality tier?
   * **IF SAME:** Then Goldfinch TVL = window into Apollo/Ares portfolio health
   * Monitor for: Increased TVL (capital flight to crypto?), decreased TVL (redemptions?)

3. **INSTITUTIONAL BRIDGE:**
   * Goldfinch = trojan horse for TradFi giants entering crypto?
   * Could Apollo/Ares tokenize $10B+ of their $480B/$308B AUMs?
   * What's preventing them? (Regulation, technology, demand?)
   * **SCENARIO:** If 5% of Apollo AUM tokenized = $24B on-chain (> current total RWA market)

**IDLE/PARETO — HIGHEST YIELDS = HIGHEST RISK:**

* **$14.3M TVL**
* Institutional credit vault: **$4.6M @ 22.7% APY**

**RISK ASSESSMENT:**

* **22.7% APY is SUBPRIME-LEVEL RISK** in current rate environment (risk-free = 4.5%)
* What's the underlying collateral? Must be extremely risky to offer 18%+ spread
* Default probability: ~15-20%? (rough estimate based on yield)
* **WHO'S BORROWING AT THESE RATES?** Desperate companies, highly cyclical industries?

**AGGREGATE ONCHAIN CREDIT RISK:**

* Total: $17.6B tokenized private credit
* If TradFi private credit defaults hit 10%, reasonable to expect onchain defaults 12-15% (worse selection bias)
* Estimated losses: $17.6B × 12% × 60% recovery = **$845M+ potential losses**
* Who bears losses? DeFi lenders (retail + institutional)
* **CONTAGION BACK TO CRYPTO:** Losses → redemptions → stablecoin selling → crypto market pressure

### 3. Bitcoin-Backed Credit: Collateral Liquidation Cascade Mechanics

**MARKET SIZE:**

* **$53.09B crypto-collateralized lending** (Q2 2025) vs $9.6B post-FTX (late 2022) = **+453% recovery**
* Q1 → Q2 2025: $39B → $53.09B = **+27.44% quarterly growth**
* CeFi concentration: **Tether + Galaxy + Ledn = 90%** of $11.2B CeFi book

**LEDN — LARGEST BITCOIN-BACKED LENDER:**

* **$550M loans** backed by **$1.35B BTC collateral**
* Collateralization ratio: **245%** (very conservative)
* Partnership: **Sygnum-Ledn $50M syndicated facility** (Aug 2025, 2x oversubscribed)

**LIQUIDATION MECHANICS RESEARCH:**

1. **CALCULATE LIQUIDATION CASCADE:**
   * Ledn $1.35B BTC collateral with 245% ratio
   * Liquidation threshold typically 120-130%
   * **Bitcoin price drop required to trigger liquidations:** (1.35B / 550M × X% drop = 130%)
   * At current BTC $110K: Liquidation price = $110K × (130% / 245%) = **$58.3K** = **-47% Bitcoin drop**

2. **STRESS TESTING:**
   * If Bitcoin drops to $70K (-36%), collateral value = $770M, LTV = 71%, still safe
   * If Bitcoin drops to $58K (-47%), liquidations begin
   * Liquidation mechanics: Automated? Manual? Over what timeframe?
   * Market impact: Selling $X BTC into market over Y hours

3. **CONTAGION PATHWAYS:**
   * One borrower liquidated → Bitcoin price drops → other borrowers closer to liquidation
   * Multiple lenders liquidate simultaneously (Ledn + Galaxy + Tether) → mega-cascade
   * **October 10, 2025 $19B liquidation:** Was ANY of this BTC-backed loans? Or just derivatives?

**TETHER — UNDISCLOSED BTC-BACKED LENDING:**

* Tether mentioned as top-3 CeFi lender (90% market share group)
* But Tether doesn't publicly report lending book size or terms
* **RESEARCH CHALLENGE:** Dig up any information on:
  * Total loans outstanding
  * Collateral types (BTC, ETH, other?)
  * Counterparties (who borrows from Tether?)
  * Terms (LTV, interest rates, liquidation thresholds)

**GALAXY DIGITAL (GLXY) — PUBLIC COMPANY ADVANTAGE:**

* Part of top-3 CeFi lenders
* **PUBLIC FILINGS AVAILABLE:** Q3 2025 10-Q should disclose:
  * Loan book size
  * Average LTV
  * Non-performing loans
  * Collateral composition

**RESEARCH:** Download Galaxy Digital Q2 and Q3 2025 earnings reports, extract ALL lending-related data.

**DEFI BTC-BACKED LENDING:**

* **AAVE, Compound, MakerDAO** all support WBTC collateral
* On-chain transparency = real-time monitoring
* Check current:
  * Total WBTC collateral locked
  * Total loans against WBTC
  * Average LTV
  * Positions close to liquidation (can query blockchain directly)

**RESEARCH TOOL:** Develop monitoring dashboard:

* DeFi Llama: Track BTC-backed lending TVL
* Aave Risk Dashboard: WBTC utilization, health factors
* CoinGecko Liquidation Levels: Track liquidation cascades real-time

### 4. October 2025 Liquidation Events: Forensic Analysis

**OCTOBER 10-11, 2025 — $19.1B LIQUIDATION (LARGEST IN CRYPTO HISTORY):**

**VERIFIED FACTS:**

* **Trigger:** Trump 100% China tariff announcement → global risk-off
* **Magnitude:** $16.7B longs + $2.4B shorts = $19.1B total
* **Bitcoin:** $125K (ATH) → $102K (low, -18.4%) → $113K stabilization
* **Altcoins:** ETH -12% (<$4K), SOL $2B liquidations → $144, XRP -22%, DOGE -21%
* **Market cap:** -$560B single day from $3.87T

**DEEP DIVE REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **EXCHANGE-BY-EXCHANGE BREAKDOWN:**
   * Binance: $X liquidated
   * Bybit: $Y liquidated
   * OKX: $Z liquidated
   * Deribit: $W liquidated (options liquidations?)
   * Which exchange saw largest liquidations? (Indicates where leverage was concentrated)

2. **LONG VS SHORT POSITIONING:**
   * $16.7B longs vs $2.4B shorts = **7:1 ratio**
   * This indicates **extreme bullish positioning** with leverage
   * Open interest before: $X, after: $Y, change: -$Z = deleveraging magnitude
   * **FUNDING RATES BEFORE EVENT:** Were funding rates extremely positive (indicating long concentration)?

3. **SPOT VS DERIVATIVES:**
   * Was this purely derivatives liquidations? Or forced spot selling?
   * Spot volume Oct 10: $X vs typical daily $Y = Z× normal
   * If spot volume spiked, indicates margin calls forced spot sales (worse contagion)

4. **INSTITUTIONAL VS RETAIL:**
   * CME Bitcoin futures liquidations: $A (institutional proxy)
   * Offshore exchange liquidations: $B (retail/prop shops proxy)
   * Ratio indicates who got caught: sophisticated or unsophisticated traders?

5. **RECOVERY DYNAMICS:**
   * $102K low → $113K stabilization = +10.8% recovery
   * How fast? 1 hour? 6 hours? 24 hours?
   * Who bought the dip? Spot flows from: exchanges, ETFs, whales (track on-chain)
   * **FOLLOW THE MONEY:** Did MicroStrategy buy the dip? Other treasury companies?

**SEPTEMBER 2025 — CUMULATIVE $6B+ STRESS:**

* Fed rate cut Sept 17 → "sell the news" + ETF outflows
* BTC: $124K (Aug) → <$109K (Sept)
* Late Sept: **$1.6B 24hr liquidation** (4th largest 2025), ETH longs $490M vs BTC $246M

**RESEARCH:**

* **ETF OUTFLOWS:** IBIT (BlackRock), FBTC (Fidelity), GBTC (Grayscale) flows Sept 1-30
* Total outflows: $X, largest single day: $Y on [date]
* Correlation: ETF outflows → price drops → liquidations (lagged by hours/days?)

**OCTOBER 17, 2025 — SECONDARY WAVE:**

* **$1.2B liquidations**, BTC <$106K, -11% (7-day)
* Indicates market **still fragile** post-tariff shock
* **CAUSE:** What triggered this? TradFi stress (regional banks)? Or technical (broken support level)?

**CONTAGION LINK TO TRADFI:**

* Oct 16-17: Regional banks crashed (KRE -6.1%, ZION -13%, WAL -10.5%, JEF -9%)
* Oct 17: Bitcoin -11% (7-day), $1.2B liquidations
* **TIMING:** TradFi stress → crypto liquidations within 24 hours
* **MECHANISM:** Hypothesis:
  1. Banks crash → risk-off sentiment → institutional allocators reduce crypto exposure
  2. Prop shops with both TradFi and crypto exposure face margin calls across portfolios
  3. Systematic de-risking: Sell most liquid assets first (crypto) to cover illiquid losses (private credit)

**DEMAND DETAILED TIMELINE:**

| Date | Time (UTC) | Event | Asset | Price/Index | Context |
|------|------------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Oct 16 | 14:30 | KRE crashes | Regional banks | -6.1% | ZION discloses $50M charge-off |
| Oct 16 | 18:00 | BTC starts dropping | Bitcoin | $113K → $110K | Follows TradFi weakness |
| Oct 17 | 02:00 | Liquidation cascade | Crypto derivatives | $400M liquidated | Asian trading hours |
| Oct 17 | 09:00 | JEF drops | Jefferies | -9% | Private credit exposure? |
| Oct 17 | 12:00 | Second liquidation wave | Crypto derivatives | $800M liquidated | Cumulative $1.2B |

### 5. Institutional Flows: JPMorgan Analysis & Correlation Dynamics

**JPMORGAN FINDINGS (2025):**

* **$60B crypto inflows YTD** (July 2025) > private equity + private credit inflows
* Flow composition: Spot ETFs (largest), CME futures, VC funding
* **KEY INSIGHT:** "Bitcoin exhibits **positive correlation with equities during stress**, NOT safe-haven behavior"

**VERIFY & QUANTIFY:**

1. **CORRELATION ANALYSIS:**
   * Calculate ρ(BTC, S&P 500) for each month 2024-2025
   * **Stress periods:** Feb-Mar 2020 (COVID), 2022 (Fed tightening), Jul-Oct 2023, Jan-Apr 2025, Sep-Oct 2025
   * ρ during stress vs calm: Hypothesis = ρ→+0.7 (stress) vs ρ→+0.3 (calm)
   * Compare to gold: ρ(gold, S&P 500) = -0.2 to -0.3 (true safe haven)

2. **INSTITUTIONAL FLOW BREAKDOWN:**
   * Spot ETFs (IBIT, FBTC, GBTC, etc.): $X cumulative inflows YTD
   * CME futures: Open interest change, institutional vs retail split
   * VC funding: Total deployed to crypto companies, stage breakdown
   * **$60B RECONCILIATION:** Do the components add up to $60B? If not, what's missing?

3. **MACRO CORRELATION — M2 MONEY SUPPLY:**
   * JPM: "Global M2 money supply correlation ρ = 0.78 (2020-2023) with ~90-day lag"
   * **TEST THIS:** Get global M2 data monthly, calculate correlation with BTC price (90-day lag)
   * **2024-2025 UPDATE:** Does correlation still hold? Or has it broken down?
   * Implication: If Fed expands balance sheet → M2 rises → BTC rises 90 days later

**PRIVATE CREDIT FUNDAMENTALS (JPM Q1 2025):**

* Default rate: **2.4%**
* Interest coverage: **2.1× (private) vs 3.9× (public)** = **-46% worse**
* Leverage: **5.6× vs 4.6×** = **+22% higher**
* EBITDA margins: **14.9% vs 16.4%** = **-9% lower profitability**

**INTERPRETATION:**

* Private credit borrowers are **lower quality** than public market borrowers
* They have **less earnings** to cover **higher debt**
* Yet defaults only 2.4% (as of Q1) — suggests **lagging recognition**
* **FORECAST:** Defaults likely to rise toward 5-8% (normalizing for quality differential)

**CONTAGION MECHANICS:**

* Private credit stress → institutional portfolios face losses
* Same institutions allocating to Bitcoin ($60B inflows)
* If losses accelerate → redemptions from ALL risk assets including Bitcoin
* **QUANTIFY:** If private credit defaults cause $50B institutional losses, what % gets redeemed from crypto?

## SYSTEMIC RISK FRAMEWORK: QUANTIFIED FAILURE MODES

### CASCADE PATHWAY #1: CONVERTIBLE DEBT DOOM LOOP

**INITIAL CONDITION:** Private credit stress → risk-off → Bitcoin drops $125K → $90K (-28%)

**STEP 1:** MSTR stock drops proportionally (β = 2.0 assumed) → $450 × 0.72 × 2.0 = **$235 (reached Feb 2025)**

**STEP 2:** Convertible notes now **deep out-of-money** → bondholders demand cash repayment → MSTR needs $5B

**STEP 3:** MSTR sells **45,000 BTC** ($5B ÷ $90K) into market over 30 days = **1,500 BTC/day**

**STEP 4:** Current BTC daily volume ~$80B → 1,500 BTC = $135M = **0.17%** of volume → manageable IF orderly

**STEP 5:** **BUT** if market front-runs (knows MSTR must sell) → BTC crashes **further** → $90K → $70K

**STEP 6:** Now MORE treasury companies at risk (Metaplanet, smaller players) → **synchronized liquidations**

**STEP 7:** Total BTC holdings 161 companies >1M BTC, assume 20% (200K BTC) need to sell → **$14B selling pressure**

**STEP 8:** $14B ÷ $80B daily volume = **17.5% of volume** over weeks = **-20-30% additional Bitcoin drop**

**FINAL STATE:** Bitcoin: $125K → $70K → $50K = **-60% total** → **Crypto winter 2026**

**PROBABILITY:** 15-25% over next 12 months (conditional on private credit crisis)

---

### CASCADE PATHWAY #2: BITCOIN-BACKED LOAN LIQUIDATIONS

**INITIAL CONDITION:** Bitcoin drops to **$70K** (-36% from $110K current)

**STEP 1:** Ledn $1.35B collateral → $1.35B × ($70K / $110K) = **$859M** new value

**STEP 2:** Against $550M loans → LTV = **64%** → Still safe (liquidation at 80%+)

**STEP 3:** But if Bitcoin drops to **$58K** (-47%), LTV → **80%** → **LIQUIDATION BEGINS**

**STEP 4:** Ledn sells $550M BTC = **9,500 BTC** into market

**STEP 5:** Simultaneously, Galaxy + Tether (90% market share) also liquidate → **30,000 BTC total selling**

**STEP 6:** 30,000 BTC × $58K = **$1.74B selling pressure** compressed into hours/days

**STEP 7:** Market impact: **-10-15% additional drop** → $58K → **$50K**

**STEP 8:** New liquidation threshold reached for lower-LTV loans → **Second wave liquidations**

**STEP 9:** DeFi protocols (AAVE, Compound, Maker) automatically liquidate WBTC positions → **On-chain chaos**

**FINAL STATE:** Multi-day liquidation cascade, Bitcoin **$110K → $45K** (-59%), **$2-3B forced selling**

**PROBABILITY:** 20-30% IF Bitcoin breaks $70K support

---

### CASCADE PATHWAY #3: TRADFI-CRYPTO CORRELATION AMPLIFICATION

**INITIAL CONDITION:** Private credit defaults hit **10%** → $2T × 10% = **$200B losses**

**STEP 1:** Bank capital impaired → $200B × 60% loss severity = **$120B bank losses**

**STEP 2:** Banks represent **$95B exposed** + $500B total → GSIB capital ratios drop → **Credit crunch**

**STEP 3:** Institutional allocators (pensions, endowments, family offices) with both TradFi + crypto exposure face **aggregate losses**

**STEP 4:** Risk committees mandate de-risking → **Sell most liquid first** = crypto (Bitcoin, ETH)

**STEP 5:** Institutional crypto allocation ~$60B (JPM inflows) × 30% redemption = **$18B selling**

**STEP 6:** Bitcoin market cap ~$2.2T → $18B = 0.8% of market cap → But compressed timeframe → **-10% price impact**

**STEP 7:** Price drop triggers derivative liquidations (repeats Oct 10) → **$10-20B additional liquidations**

**STEP 8:** **Total:** $18B institutional + $15B liquidations = **$33B selling** → **-25% Bitcoin drop**

**STEP 9:** Media narrative: "Crypto contagion from banking crisis" → Retail panic → **-10% additional**

**FINAL STATE:** Bitcoin **-35% total** → $110K → **$72K** in 2-4 weeks

**PROBABILITY:** 40-50% IF private credit crisis materializes

## DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS

**RESEARCH REPORT MUST INCLUDE:**

1. **Bitcoin Price Cascade Model:**
   * Input: Private credit default rate (2%, 5%, 10%, 15%)
   * Output: Expected Bitcoin price (with confidence intervals)
   * Key assumptions: Treasury company leverage, loan liquidation thresholds, institutional correlation
   * Sensitivity analysis: Which input matters most?

2. **Treasury Company Risk Ranking:**
   * All 161 companies (or as many as identifiable)
   * Ranked by: Debt/BTC ratio, NAV premium compression, stock performance, liquidity
   * Top 20 highest risk: Names, tickers, exact metrics
   * Liquidation probability: High/Medium/Low with quantitative thresholds

3. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard Specifications:**
   * **Daily:** MSTR/MARA/BTCS stock prices, NAV premiums, BTC price, correlation ρ(BTC, SPX)
   * **Weekly:** Tokenized RWA TVL (rwa.xyz), DeFi lending TVL, institutional flows (ETF + CME)
   * **Monthly:** Treasury company BTC holdings (SEC 8-K filings), debt issuance, defaults

4. **Contagion Scenario Matrix:**

| Private Credit Default Rate | Bank Losses | Institutional Redemptions | BTC Liquidations | Expected BTC Price | Probability |
|----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 2-3% (current) | <$20B | Minimal | <$5B | $100-120K | 40% (base case) |
| 5-6% | $50-80B | Moderate ($10-15B) | $10-15B | $75-90K | 30% |
| 8-10% | $100-150B | High ($20-30B) | $20-30B | $50-70K | 20% |
| 12-15% | $200B+ | Severe ($40B+) | $40B+ | $30-50K | 10% |

5. **Institutional Flow Forensics:**
   * $60B inflows breakdown: IBIT $X, FBTC $Y, GBTC $Z, CME $W, other $V
   * Inflow/outflow by week (Jan-Oct 2025)
   * Correlation with Bitcoin price (lead/lag analysis)
   * **PREDICTION:** If outflows hit $X billion/week, expect Bitcoin -Y%

6. **Source Documentation:** Same standards as Research Prompt #1
   * Every number sourced with [Entity, Filing/Report, Date, Page/URL]
   * Direct quotes with timestamps
   * Blockchain data with transaction hashes where applicable

**PRIORITY INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONS (ANSWER THESE FIRST):**

1. What are the EXACT convertible note terms for MSTR's $7.27B debt? (Conversion prices, maturity dates, cash-out thresholds)
2. At what Bitcoin price does MSTR face forced liquidation? (Quantitative model)
3. Which of the 161 treasury companies are at highest risk? (Top 20 ranking)
4. What is the total BTC-backed loan liquidation threshold across all CeFi+DeFi? ($ amount at different BTC prices)
5. How much institutional capital could redeem from crypto if private credit implodes? ($X redemption for $Y PC losses)
6. What was the EXACT mechanism of the Oct 10 $19B liquidation? (Exchange-by-exchange, long/short, spot/derivative)
7. Is the ρ(BTC, SPX) correlation increasing? (30/60/90-day rolling, current vs historical)
8. Has ANY treasury company's NAV premium gone negative besides Metaplanet? (Daily tracking)
9. What did the removed CoinDesk article say about treasury company stress? (Investigative journalism)
10. Are private credit firms (Apollo, Ares, Blackstone, KKR) invested in crypto treasury companies? (Trace capital flows)

**THIS RESEARCH DETERMINES WHETHER BITCOIN SURVIVES A PRIVATE CREDIT CRISIS. EVERY FINDING MUST BE ACTIONABLE FOR PORTFOLIO POSITIONING.**
