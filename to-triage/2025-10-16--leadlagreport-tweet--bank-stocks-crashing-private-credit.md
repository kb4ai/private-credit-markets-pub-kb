## Context

This tweet highlights the significant crash in regional bank stocks on October 16, 2025, with Michael Gayed connecting it to private credit market stress. The tweet suggests that:

* The China trade war narrative may be diverting attention from underlying banking system issues
* Regional banks are experiencing acute stress
* Private credit market problems may be the root cause

This aligns with the analysis in the Coin Bureau Trading video that references this tweet, where Dan discusses how private credit stress is beginning to affect the banking system and cryptocurrency markets.
