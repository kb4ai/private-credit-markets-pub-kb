Alright Greg — here’s a first cut that answers the highest-priority items with hard numbers, filings, and paths to action. I’ve kept it dense and decision-oriented; feel free to tell me where to go deeper next.

# 1) MSTR: exact convert terms, cash-repay risk, & sell-pressure math

## Capital stack — maturities, conversion prices (post 10:1 split), and sizes

(“$ size” = original principal issued; outstanding may be slightly lower due to repurchases/settlements. Sources immediately after table.)

| Tranche            | Coupon |          Maturity |      Initial size | **Split-adj. conversion price** | Notes                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | -----: | ----------------: | ----------------: | ------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2027 converts      |  0.75% |  Dec 15, **2027** |             $650m |                     **$143.25** | Early convert from 2021 deal; price shown is split-adjusted per company 8-K. ([SEC][1])                       |
| 2028 converts      |  0.00% | Sept 15, **2028** |        **$1.01b** |                     **$183.19** | Issued Sept 18, 2024; $1.01b principal; 0% due 2028. ([Strategy][2])                                          |
| 2029 converts      |  0.00% |  Nov 15, **2029** |        **$3.00b** |                     **$672.40** | Issued Nov 21, 2024 (Rule 144A). ([SEC][3])                                                                   |
| 2030 converts (0%) |  0.00% |  Feb 15, **2030** |        **$2.00b** |                     **$433.43** | Issued Feb 24, 2025; initial conversion rate 2.3072 sh/$1,000 pre-split → $433.43 post-split. ([Strategy][4]) |
| 2031 converts      | 0.625% |      Mar **2031** | (reported ~$800m) |                     **$232.72** | Issued Mar 2024; split-adjusted conversion price per 8-K. ([Nasdaq][5])                                       |
| 2032 converts      |  2.25% |  Jun 15, **2032** | (reported ~$800m) |                     **$204.33** | Issued Jun 13, 2024; split-adjusted conversion price per 8-K. ([Nasdaq][6])                                   |

**Where these numbers come from:** Company 8-K (July 31, 2025) lists split-adjusted *conversion prices* for all outstanding convert tranches; press/filing summaries provide original issue sizes & coupons. ([SEC][1])

### Who owns the converts / private-credit angle?

All the large convert deals were sold under **Rule 144A** to “qualified institutional buyers,” typically convertible-arb hedge funds and multi-strategy desks; individual buyer lists aren’t disclosed and we find **no evidence** of Apollo/Ares/Blackstone/KKR publicly owning these notes or of these notes being placed into CLOs. (144A marketing norms explained here.) Net: treat buyers as hedge-fund converts desks unless a future 13F/holder leak shows otherwise. ([Investing.com][7])

## “Cash-repay” risk & BTC threshold logic

* **Cash obligation risk** exists when a tranche is **OTM at its maturity** and MSTR can’t roll/refinance; then principal must be repaid in cash (or via new issuance).
* Today, multiple tranches’ **conversion prices ($204–$672)** are above spot MSTR at various times in 2025; if that persists into their maturities and capital markets shut, **principal at risk** ≈ sum of OTM tranches maturing before markets reopen. (The user’s “$5B at risk” in Feb’25 was directionally consistent when 2028+2029+2030 were well OTM.)
* **BTC price needed to “save” a tranche** is indirect: it depends on MSTR share price vs that tranche’s **conversion price**, and MSTR’s **beta to BTC** over the relevant horizon. Practically, you set a target MSTR price ≥ the tranche’s conversion price, then back out the BTC level using the current **rolling MSTR↔BTC elasticity** (β≈1.5–3.0 historically; needs live calc — see §5).

## Forced selling math (order-of-magnitude)

* Latest disclosed BTC pile (Q2’25 & late-July updates): **~628,791 BTC** after a big July purchase; treasuries trackers show ~640k by late Sep (difference = late-Q3 buys). I’ll use **~630k BTC** for conservative sizing.
* If $**5.0B** cash** had** to be raised via BTC sales:

  * At **$110k/BTC** → **~45,500 BTC**
  * At **$90k/BTC** → **~55,600 BTC**
  * At **$70k/BTC** → **~71,400 BTC**
    (Simple: BTC_to_sell = cash_need / BTC_price.)
* **Market-impact lens:** during the Oct 10–11 shock, **$19.1B** liquidations hit derivatives (≈$16.7B longs), with BTC spot printing ~$102–$114k intraday on thin liquidity. A **$5B spot sell** if telegraphed would likely be sliced & routed; depth would matter more than “% of average daily volume.” Use the Oct 10 tape as your stress anchor, not average volumes.

> **Takeaway:** The **binding constraint is refinancing**, not an overnight BTC fire-sale. If 2028–2030 tranches are OTM at their maturities **and** credit windows are shut, MSTR’s fallback is treasury BTC. The reflexivity risk: announced selling → price gap down → worsens OTM status on later tranches.

# 2) Treasury-company risk: Metaplanet signal, MARA/BTCS specifics, early ranking

## Metaplanet (3350.T) — premium collapse to **~mNAV 0.99×**

* Metaplanet’s market value vs BTC holdings (“mNAV multiple”) **collapsed** from >**5×** (June ’25) to ~**1.0×** by **Oct ’25**, with stock down ~**75%** — the first prominent BTC-treasury vehicle trading **at/under NAV** this cycle. This breaks the “equity wrapper” flywheel (equity becomes a *worse* way to buy BTC). ([REX Shares][8])

**Why this matters for contagion:** When equity wrappers go to **≤1.0× NAV**, PIPE / convert / ATM equity becomes uneconomic. Expect issuance windows to close first for smaller wrappers; MSTR would be later/last given scale/liquidity, but the mechanism is the same.

## Marathon Digital (MARA)

* BTC treasury: **~53k BTC** (Oct ’25 cited levels).
* Balance sheet converts: **~$750–950m** outstanding across 2026/2031 deals (0.75% 2026; 2.00% 2031; 1.00% 2031; terms vary by deal).
* Operations generate cash when hashprice favorable; dual exposure = **treasury BTC + mining margins** (difficulty/energy). ([CoinDesk][9])

## BTCS — **ETH pivot + DeFi leverage**

* July 8, 2025: company announced **$57.8–$100m** convert authorization & **Aave-based** stablecoin borrowing to buy up to **14,600 ETH**; stock spiked ~**+100%** on the plan. (On-chain position address still to be confirmed; Aave risk = liquidation at collateral ratio breach.) ([Strategy][10])

## Early “Top-Risk” screen (method + initial names)

**Method:** rank by **Debt / (Market value of BTC/ETH holdings)**, **mNAV multiple compression**, **funding reliance** (PIPE/ATM/convert), and **operating cash cushions**.

**Initial high-risk bucket (from public info):**

* **Metaplanet (3350.T):** mNAV ≈ **0.99×**, -75% equity → **issuance shut** risk = high. ([REX Shares][8])
* **BTCS (BTCS):** DeFi leverage on Aave + convert plan; liquidation risk tied to **ETH levels**. **Action:** pull vault address + liquidation price from Aave UI/contract. ([Strategy][10])
* **Smaller BTC wrappers** (Japan/US microcaps highlighted by Bitbo/treasuries trackers) showing sharp multiple compression; require case-by-case debt checks.

> **To expand to “161 companies”:** We’ll pull programmatically from **Bitbo / BitcoinTreasuries** and cross-join with filings to fill **BTC/ETH holdings, debt, and mNAV** columns, then rank. (Today’s step delivers framework + first flags; full table is long but feasible to compile.)

# 3) On-chain Private Credit (RWA) — size, leaders, risks

## Market size & mix (as of Oct ’25)

* **Total tokenized RWA** ≈ **$33.9B**. ([RWA.xyz][11])
* **Private credit** “active loans” ≈ **$17.6B** (≈**58%** of RWA), per RWA.xyz dashboards. **Fastest growth vertical.** ([CoinGecko Assets][12])

## Figure / Provenance

* **FIGR IPO (Nasdaq, Sept 2025):** debut valued **~$7.6B**; Reuters confirms pricing/valuation. ([RWA][13])
* **Market footprint:** RWA trackers, Prop/Provenance stats, and industry reports attribute a **double-digit billions** AUM to Provenance loan pools; Figure frequently cited as category leader through HELOC & consumer credit securitizations. (Exact live AUM fluctuates on-chain; use RWA.xyz chain share breakdown.) ([RWA.xyz][11])

**What to pull next (actionable):** FIGR **10-Q** post-IPO for origination mix (HELOC/consumer), FICO/LTV, delinquency, and securitization take-out buyers (e.g., Apollo/Ares). Then tie into **private-credit crossover** map.

## Tradable (zkSync) + Victory Park Capital (VPC)

* **Active loans:** **$1.8B**, **30+ positions**, yields **~8–15.5%**, with VPC partnership noted across RWA trackers & protocol docs. High-yield sleeves include fintech senior secured, **legal receivables**, and royalties. **Risk:** idiosyncratic default/collection timing. ([CoinGecko Assets][12])

## Maple Finance

* Q2’25 footprint: **$600–800m** active loans/TVL; **lifetime >$3.3B**.
* **2022 crisis forensics:** Orthogonal Trading default **$31m USDC** + **~3,900 wETH (~$5m)** in M11 pools → led to **Maple 2.0** with stricter default handling & pool governance.
* **Institutional validation:** Bitwise allocation in 2025 reported; (next step: amount via Bitwise/Maple comms).

## Goldfinch Prime (ultra-insto gateway)

* **Partners displayed:** Ares, Apollo, Golub et al., target **~10–12% net**, **≥90% senior-secured**, non-accrual target **<0.75%**; curated BDC exposure on-chain (Heron CP notes). **This is the clearest “TradFi → on-chain” bridge.**

## Idle / **Pareto**

* Rebrand to **Pareto**; institutional **credit vaults** (Bastion, Fasanara, FalconX, etc.) and a credit-backed **USP** synthetic $ in 2025. Historical **senior/junior** tranche APYs commonly show **~8–12%** senior vs **~20%+** junior in campaign periods → **subprime-equivalent risk** on juniors.

> **Quant risk sketch:** If **$17.6B** on-chain private credit suffers **12%** defaults with **60%** recovery → **~$845m** losses borne by LPs (retail + insto). Expect forced redemptions from tokenized funds + stablecoin selling → spillover to crypto prices.

---

# 4) BTC-backed credit — liquidation math & lenders

## Market size & composition

* **Crypto-collateralized lending (CeFi+DeFi+CDPs)** rose **+27.4% QoQ** in **Q2’25** to **$53.09B** (Galaxy Research). DeFi ≈ ~60% share.

## Ledn + Sygnum (banked, tokenized private credit)

* **$50m** BTC-backed syndicated loan arranged **Aug 2024**; **refinanced Aug 27, 2025** and **2× oversubscribed**, with a **tokenized** sleeve for distribution. **Ledn book** heavily BTC-backed (Galaxy note: 99% BTC).

**Liquidation threshold math (Ledn stylized):**
If loans **$550m** secured by **$1.35b BTC** (LTV ~**41%**, collateralization **~245%**), first liquidations typically kick at **120–130%** collateralization. Price that takes **245% → 130%** is **~53%** of start. **From $110k → ~$58k BTC** you’re at the edge — consistent with the stress point in your prompt.

## Galaxy Digital (public; transparent lending book)

* Q2’25 **avg loan book >$1.0B**; **~$1.4B outstanding** at quarter end; no past-dues disclosed. **LTVs** set vs ADV/liquidity constraints; they run lower LTVs when size vs ADV is high. **This is useful for cascade modeling by volume tiers.**

## Tether

* Frequently cited among largest CeFi lenders; **public transparency on loan book is limited**. Treat as “unknown size, conservative modeling”: include as a concurrent liquidator in cascade scenarios but with **wide error bars**.

---

# 5) Oct 10–11, 2025 liquidation shock — what we know

**Facts from primary coverage:**

* **Trigger:** U.S. President Trump floated **100% China tariffs** → global risk-off.
* **Magnitude:** **~$19.1B** total liquidations; **~$16–17B longs** (largest on record). BTC print **~$102–114k** before stabilizing ~**$113–114k** by Oct 13. **Altcoins** fell harder; some stablecoin pegs briefly wobbled.

**Gaps to fill (next step):** Exchange-by-exchange breakdown (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit); exact CME flush; perp funding snapshot pre-event; spot vs derivatives share. (CoinDesk mentions elements; CoinGlass can break by venue.)

> **Link to TradFi stress (Oct 16–17):** Regional banks dumped (KRE ~-6%, ZION/WAL double digits), and Jamie Dimon warned “when you see one cockroach…” about private-credit failures — **exactly the cross-asset channel you hypothesized.**

---

# 6) Institutional flows & correlation

* **JPMorgan (Jul 24, 2025):** estimates **~$60B YTD** net crypto inflows, with **spot ETFs** the biggest driver.
* **ETF flows (Sept–Oct 2025):** Farside live sheets show **several large outflow days** in Sept and **sizeable net outflows** around Oct 13–16. Use these for flow→price regressions.
* **Correlation:** JPM’s investor note (evergreen page) states BTC has behaved as a **risk asset** since 2020, with **positive stock/bond correlations** (poor diversifier) — consistent with your “correlation rises in stress” thesis.

# 7) Answers to your **Priority Intelligence Questions**

1. **Exact MSTR convertible terms?** — Table in §1 (maturities 2027/28/29/30/31/32; conversion prices $143→$672 split-adjusted; sizes noted), all tied to 8-K + offering releases. ([SEC][1])

2. **BTC price at which MSTR faces forced liquidation?**
   There’s **no automatic BTC margin** on MSTR; the **forced-cash** risk is **convert principal due when OTM at maturity** *and* refinancing unavailable. Practically, if MSTR < a tranche’s **conversion price** into maturity and credit shuts, cash = principal for that tranche. Back-solve BTC via **β(MSTR,BTC)** (rolling 60-90d). (We’ll compute fresh betas from daily data in the next pass.)

3. **Which of 161 treasury firms are most at risk?**
   Today’s **high-risk** flags: **Metaplanet (mNAV ~1.0×)**, **BTCS (Aave liquidation path)**, and smaller BTC wrappers with collapsing mNAVs. MSTR’s risk is **not liquidity**, it’s **refinancing** if multiples compress and Nasdaq’s new shareholder-approval constraints bind. **Next step:** build the 161-name table from Bitbo/BitcoinTreasuries + filings. ([REX Shares][8])

4. **Total BTC-backed loan liquidation threshold (CeFi+DeFi)?**
   Galaxy pegs total crypto-collateralized lending at **$53.1B** (Q2’25). Assume **BTC share ~50–60%** (directional). With average LTV **50–60%** DeFi and **lower** at Galaxy/Ledn, first big wave triggers near **BTC $55–60k** (example: Ledn math). Size of *forced* BTC sells in wave-1 could be **$1–2B** in hours if multiple desks liquidate simultaneously.

5. **How much could redeem from crypto if private credit cracks?**
   If private-credit losses of **$50B** hit multi-asset allocators, a **30% de-risk** on the **$60B** 2025 crypto inflow cohort implies **~$18B** gross selling — enough to catalyze a **double-digit** BTC draw, even before derivatives spillovers.

6. **Oct 10 mechanism (venue split, long/short, spot/deriv)?**
   Confirmed **derivative-led** with **~$16–17B longs** flushed; more venue granularity to fetch from CoinGlass/CoinDesk data feeds.

7. **Is ρ(BTC, SPX) increasing?**
   JPM and price action argue **yes in stress**; we’ll compute 30/60/90-day rolling ρ and β next (methodology defined; run over 2024–2025 with event windows).

8. **Any other treasury wrappers at negative NAV premiums?**
   **Metaplanet confirmed** ~1.0×; others show **compression** but need daily scrape of treasuries dashboards to confirm <1.0× prints. ([REX Shares][8])

9. **“Removed CoinDesk article”**
   We do have fresh CoinDesk coverage on **PIPEs** (Oct 16) and the liquidation weekend; locating a **pulled July–Aug article** will require **Wayback** and reporter outreach. (We’ll try targeted archive queries by author/title in the next pass.)

10. **Are Apollo/Ares/Blackstone/KKR invested in crypto treasuries?**
    No public evidence of them buying **MSTR converts**. Their **Goldfinch Prime** exposure is to **traditional private-credit funds tokenized on-chain**, not BTC treasury equities. Track **PIPE** participants in smaller wrappers for any private-credit shop footprints.

# 8) Bitcoin price **Cascade Model** (v0.1)

**Inputs:** private-credit default rate; ETF flows; treasury issuance window (open/closed); BTC-backed loan LTV distribution; derivatives positioning.

**Stylized outputs (point estimates; to be refined with time-series regressions):**

|     PC default rate | Bank/credit losses (est.) | Est. crypto redemptions | Forced BTC liquidations | **Expected BTC** |
| ------------------: | ------------------------: | ----------------------: | ----------------------: | ---------------: |
| **2–3%** (base now) |                     <$20B |                 Minimal |                    <$5B |    **$100–120k** |
|            **5–6%** |                   $50–80B |                 $10–15B |                 $10–15B |      **$75–90k** |
|           **8–10%** |                 $100–150B |                 $20–30B |                 $20–30B |      **$50–70k** |
|          **12–15%** |                    $200B+ |                   $40B+ |                   $40B+ |      **$30–50k** |

**Sensitivity (largest levers):** (1) ETF flow regime; (2) credit window for MSTR/MARA/BTCS issuance; (3) BTC-backed loan LTVs (CeFi) near **$55–60k** trigger.

# 9) Monitoring dashboard (spec you can implement)

**Daily**

* Prices: **BTC**, **MSTR**, **MARA**, **BTCS**; **mNAV multiples** for wrappers (Metaplanet, others).
* **ETF flow** tape (Farside).
* **Aave/Maker/Aave-Arb**: WBTC/ETH health-factor heatmap.

**Weekly**

* **RWA.xyz**: total RWA, **private-credit active loans**.
* **Galaxy** lending KPIs (if disclosed intra-qtr), Ledn announcements.
* **Futures positioning** (CME COT), **funding rates**.

**Event-driven**

* Liquidations > **$1B** (CoinGlass feed), bank stress headlines (KRE, ZION/WAL prints), Nasdaq/SEC rule changes on treasury issuance.

# 10) “Convertible debt doom-loop” thresholds for MSTR (framework)

1. **Identify tranches maturing next 24–36 months** (2027–2030).
2. **Flag OTM tranches** given current MSTR.
3. **Refi window status** (Nasdaq added **shareholder-approval** friction for crypto capital raises in Sept ’25).
4. **If shut**, cash need ≈ principal of those OTM maturities.
5. **BTC selling plan** sizing: $ cash ÷ BTC price grid (110k/90k/70k) → BTC to sell; compare to **stress-day depth** (use Oct 10–11 as liquidity benchmark rather than average).

---

# 11) To-do items I’ll tackle next (if you want me to continue)

* **Roll 30/60/90-day** ρ and β: {BTC vs SPX, MSTR vs BTC, MSTR vs SPX}.
* **Venue-level liquidation** breakdown for Oct 10–11 (Binance/Bybit/OKX/Deribit/CME).
* **Full 161-company table** with BTC/ETH holdings, debt, mNAV, YTD perf; top-20 ranked by composite risk.
* **BTCS Aave position**: verify vault address & **liquidation ETH price**, LTV ladder.
* **FIGR** post-IPO filings: loan quality metrics, default rates, securitization counterparties (Apollo/Ares/KKR tie-ins).

If you want, I can spin up the **161-name risk table** next and run the **correlation/beta** calcs so we can put hard BTC thresholds under each convert tranche (e.g., “BTC ≥ $X keeps 2029s in-the-money at the current elasticity”).
