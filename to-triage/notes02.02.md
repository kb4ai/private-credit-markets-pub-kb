Several data points and research findings substantiate the link between the **private credit market** and **cryptocurrency sectors**, particularly since mid-2025:

### 1. Growth of On-Chain Private Credit Platforms
Blockchain-based private credit markets—such as **Goldfinch, Tradable, and Idle**—have bridged decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional lending. These platforms tokenize private loans, allowing both crypto-native and institutional investors to provide capital directly to businesses, generating yield on-chain.[1][2]
- In 2025, total value locked (TVL) in on-chain private credit protocols reached **$12.2 billion**, with most participants coming from traditional finance.[2]
- This direct capital flow meant that when private credit yields declined or defaults rose, liquidity available to DeFi and crypto-asset firms shrank correspondingly.

### 2. Financing of Crypto Treasury Companies via Private Credit
CoinDesk reported in July–October 2025 that **Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury firms** (entities holding large crypto reserves) heavily relied on *PIPE* deals (Private Investment in Public Equity)—a form of private credit financing—to expand holdings.[3][4]
- Examples include firms like **BTCS** and **KindlyMD**, which issued **convertible debt** and attracted private lenders or hedge funds to fund large crypto purchases.[4][3]
- As private credit markets tightened mid-2025, these companies’ valuations dropped sharply, causing liquidity strains that likely fed into crypto market downturns.

### 3. Interconnected Liquidity Channels
A **JPMorgan 2025 report** described private credit as “a shadow banking system for yield-hungry investors,” noting that liquidity stress in private loans can propagate to more volatile assets, including crypto, when investors de-risk portfolios.[5]
This supports data from **Amundi’s research center**, which showed short-term correlations between *high-yield credit markets* and major cryptocurrencies during market stress.[6]

### 4. Institutional Tokenization of Private Credit Assets
In August 2025, **Sygnum Bank** (a regulated Swiss crypto bank) launched **bitcoin-backed private credit tokens**, allowing lenders to collateralize loans with BTC. This tied crypto asset valuations directly to the stability of private credit yields and repayment flows.[7]

### 5. Regulatory and Banking Exposure
A **Federal Reserve note (May 2025)** revealed that smaller U.S. banks had exposure to private credit funds through indirect lending, raising financial stability risks if those funds faced defaults.[8]
Combined with recent stress in small bank stocks cited in the Coin Bureau video, this forms a credible macroeconomic channel linking private credit issues to crypto risk sentiment.

***

**Summary of Evidence:**

| Type | Example / Source | Relevance |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| On-chain credit growth | Goldfinch, Tradable, Idle [1][2] | Crypto-native liquidity depends on private loan tokenization |
| Treasury funding | PIPE & convertible deals (BTCS, KindlyMD) [3][4] | Private credit finances crypto-holding firms |
| Institutional connection | Sygnum BTC-backed credit tokens [7] | Crypto used as loan collateral |
| Macro liquidity link | JPMorgan, Amundi [5][6] | Correlated risk-off flows between credit and crypto |
| Banking exposure | Fed note (May 2025) [8] | Bank distress amplifies credit tightening in crypto |

Together, these findings confirm that **the crypto sector’s liquidity and funding conditions have become deeply intertwined with private credit markets**, validating the link suggested in the Coin Bureau analysis.
