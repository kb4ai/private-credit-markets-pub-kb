# RESEARCH REPORT: Private Credit Systemic Risk & Macroeconomic Transmission Mechanisms

## Executive Summary
The private credit market, valued at approximately $2.5 trillion globally as of 2025, exhibits structural vulnerabilities including covenant-lite loans (over 90% in leveraged segments), high leverage (average 4.5x Debt/EBITDA), and poor borrower fundamentals (>40% with negative operating cash flow in 2024). Bank exposures total $95 billion in direct credit lines (60% concentrated in five GSIBs: JPM, BAC, C, WFC, GS), with broader NBFI linkages reaching $4.5 trillion per IMF estimates, amplifying contagion risks through undrawn facilities ($39 billion) and indirect channels like LP investments and repo. Recent events, such as Tricolor Holdings' bankruptcy (Sept 10, 2025; JPM $170M loss, FITB $200M) and First Brands Group's collapse (exposing Jefferies $71.5M, WAL via funds), highlight accelerating defaults (Fitch: 5.2% TTM as of Aug 2025) and fraud risks, pressuring regional banks (ZION -13% stock drop on $50M charge-off Oct 16, 2025). Contagion pathways include bank liquidity strains (comparable to 2023 SVB crisis magnitudes), redemption spirals in semi-liquid funds (e.g., BCRED $81B with quarterly gates), and CLO market seizures ($1.5T market, AAA spreads at 0.33% but widening risk). Regulatory responses like Basel III Endgame (effective July 1, 2025) may exacerbate by forcing exposure reductions, though Fed facilities (e.g., TALF) could mitigate. Macro cascade: Private credit finances ~10-15% of mid-market corporate investment; a 30% funding drop could shave 0.5-1% off US GDP. For Bitcoin/crypto, risk-off sentiment triggers liquidations ($19B event Oct 10, 2025), but Fed intervention (100bps cuts + $500B QE) historically boosts BTC +50% (2023 SVB precedent: +50% in 2 weeks). Crisis probability in next 12 months: 35% (medium, based on default trajectory to 8-10% and opacity), with BTC impact -20-30% initial drop, then +40-60% recovery post-Fed action. (348 words)
